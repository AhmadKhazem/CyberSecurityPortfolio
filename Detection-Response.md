üß† **Skills Learned:**

### **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**  
- Developed an understanding of how Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) like Suricata work to detect and alert on malicious network traffic.  
- Learned how to read and interpret IDS logs and signatures.  
- Understood how Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) provide value by identifying threats through network traffic monitoring.  
- Gained hands-on experience in setting up basic IDS rules to trigger alerts and detect attacks.

### **Incident Response**  
- Explained the lifecycle of an incident including detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.  
- Identified the roles and responsibilities within an incident response team.  
- Used VirusTotal and other tools to analyze suspicious file hashes and investigate security incidents.  
- Reconstructed incident timelines by mapping digital artifacts.  
- Practiced triaging alerts based on evidence and determined appropriate response actions.

### **Technical Documentation**  
- Learned best practices for documenting during all phases of incident response.  
- Collected and maintained evidence systematically for future reference and compliance.  
- Created records that support investigations and post-incident review processes.

### **Network Protocols**  
- Captured and analyzed live network traffic using packet sniffing tools such as tcpdump and Wireshark.  
- Interpreted packet data to identify normal and abnormal network communications.  
- Understood how to filter and investigate packets to detect security issues.  
- Gained familiarity with common commands and techniques used to analyze protocols in packet capture tools.

### **Log Analysis & SIEM Tools**  
- Understood the importance of log data in security monitoring and incident investigation.  
- Learned how SIEM tools like Splunk and Google SecOps (Chronicle) collect, normalize, and analyze logs.  
- Performed basic search queries in SIEM tools to investigate suspicious activities.  
- Navigated and utilized IDS and SIEM interfaces for monitoring and detection tasks.
